# Time-Series-Load-Prediction-with-LSTM
This project implements a short-term electricity demand forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The model uses engineered time-series features such as lags, rolling statistics, and cyclical encoding to learn temporal patterns from historical electricity demand and weather data.

**Key Features**: Time-series feature engineering including lags, rolling mean and standard deviation, and cyclical encoding. Robust scaling for outlier handling. Stacked LSTM layers for capturing long-term dependencies. Dropout regularization for better generalization. Evaluation using RMSE and MSE.

**Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn.
